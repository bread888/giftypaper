## Getting Started

Outside of this repo, you can start a new project with this template using [C3](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/c3/) (the `create-cloudflare` CLI):

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest -- --template=cloudflare/templates/astro-blog-starter-template
```

A live public deployment of this template is available at [https://astro-blog-starter-template.templates.workers.dev](https://astro-blog-starter-template.templates.workers.dev)

## 🚀 Project Structure

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                           | Action                                           |

## ✉️ Contact form delivery

The “Prenota questo kit” flow now submits form data to `POST /api/contact`, which forwards the request to SendGrid so you receive the customer email without relying on a mail client.

- `CONTACT_SENDGRID_API_KEY` (required): the SendGrid API key stored as a secret (e.g., `wrangler secret put CONTACT_SENDGRID_API_KEY`).
- `CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL` (optional): the sender address that appears in the delivered email (defaults to `no-reply@giftypaper.it`).
- `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL` (optional): where the requests are sent (defaults to `info@giftypaper.it`).

Kit buttons now prefill the message textarea with the appropriate code and title (e.g., “Vorrei avere informazioni in merito a SVCGP0001, Kit Piccoli Tesori”).

You can test the flow locally with `npm run dev`; server-side errors are written to the console and surfaced in the feedback line under the textarea.
